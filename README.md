# tkrb_kiwi_lv

## About this app:

This is a Streamlit app informing user what level their sword character will return as from kiwame training in the game Touken Ranbu ONLINE. It is mainly meant for use with characters that have not yet achieved level 99, given the game's recent changes allowing untrained swords to store "extra" EXP (which unfortunately cannot be tracked). The app can be accessed here: https://share.streamlit.io/yae-sushi/tkrb_kiwi_lv/main/kiwame_return_calc.py.
